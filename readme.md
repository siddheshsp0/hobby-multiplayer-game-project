## Hobby Multiplayer Game Project

This is my test version 0 of a multiplayer game I am working on, as a hobby.
I have only implemented multiplayer feature, which is a bit buggy (position offset).

This project is built on:
Server: Spring boot
Client/Game: libgdx

# How to run
To run this project, launch the server by changing your directory to serverside/survivalpixel2d.server/ and run "./mnvw spring-boot:run". To launch clients, change your directory to /clientside/ and run "./gradlew run". Launch multiple clients using the same command.

# What I plan to add:
* Some more basic features like login, player tags, world memory, multiple worlds
* Sandbox like infinite terrain generation (inspired by minecraft)
* Environment and player interaction
* Different environments

# Output
You can see the current development in the form of videos in /output folder.
